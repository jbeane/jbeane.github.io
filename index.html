		<h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
		<p>I am a web developer and avid bunny guy.  I like solving problems and learning new stuff to maintain my worth to salt ratio. I currently work at a digital signage company and helped create the application for <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/express-image-expands-from-6-to-nearly-100-digital-directories-at-mall-of-america-300473680.html">digital directories</a> in the Mall of America. More about my current/past employment on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-beane-691aa722/">Linkedin</a>.</p>

		<h2>Photos</h2>
		<p>I like taking pictures of things that interest me like bugs, flowers, landscapes, and yes of course bunnies. My bunnies are my pride and joy, so I hope the pictures can brighten someones day as they do mine.</p>
